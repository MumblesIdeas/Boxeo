// I guess the thing I need to figure out is how to actually implement what I'm thinking into this program.
// What I want to do is set up an actual device/app on screen that helps us score rounds in boxing.
// There will be a boxing mode and an MMA mode. These two sports have different scoring criteria.
// For boxing...
// Round can go anywhere from 1 to 12 rouds.
// Bouts range from 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 rounds. I might need to double check this one out.
//
// Boxing...
// It is scored on a 10 - 9 round basis.
// Meaning. The winner of the round is awarded 10 points. The loser is awarded 9.
// However, if there is a knockdown. The person who got the knocked-down loses a point.
// Anoter way you can lose a point in boxing is by referee takes away a point.
//
// Note...you can't earn points. You can only lose points.
// Boxing is fought between two boxers. Boxer A is in the red corner and Boxer B is in the blue corner.
//
// Questions to ask..
// 1. Who won the round>
// 2. Was there a knockdown?
// 3. Was there a point taken away?

// Things to consider...
// A. What happens if theres a knockout? How am I going to handle this?
// B.
//
// Psudocode.
// Who won the round?
// If winner of round is (Boxer A or Boxer B) then
//      add 10 points to Total Score of Round Winner
//      add 9 points to Total Score of Loser of Round.
//
// I have to do this anywhere from [1,12].
// Once this happens...
// I need to return the the total score of Boxer A
// and
// I need to return the total score of Boxer B
// and then compare the two to give us the winner of a fight.
